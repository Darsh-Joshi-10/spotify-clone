# spotify-clone
I attempted to make this spotify clone to try out my skills in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I took reference from the Sigma Web Development series on youtube by CODEWITHHARRY. It is a really interesting full stack development course and was really helpful in learning the necessary skills.

This project is still under progress and Im actively working on it so that its a great presentable project.
